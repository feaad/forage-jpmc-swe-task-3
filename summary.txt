Explanation

To illustrate a visual representation of the data, the ratio of stock ABC and stock 
DEF was calculated and a lower and upper bound (+/- 10%) was also defined. To do this, 
the existing schema was updated to illustrate the new structure. This new structure 
showed the upper and lower bound, the trading opportunities (this is when the ratio of 
ABC and DEF where either above the upper bound or below the lower bound) and the ratio 
of the two stocks.

For the purposes of showing a more frequent trading opportunity, I changed the lower and 
upper bound in the DataManipulator.ts file to read +/- 5% and went on further to display
the trading opportunity below the graph. I did this to help traders easily see the 
opportunities instead of having to place their cursors on the graph. This in effect would
reduce the amount of time spent identifying opportunities. To do this I created a 
showOpp() function in the AlertsDisplay.ts file, which took in two parameters; the trading 
opportunity ratio and the date and timestamp from the graph and had this information 
displayed via an HTML table.

Insights

The trader can now easily identify trading opportunities. 
Have the ratio of the two stocks displayed against a historical correlation.
